I would
like to inform you in writing that the leak in our garage is
making the use of our garage impossible.

It has
spread from the cast iron pipe joint across to the middle of
the concrete ceiling and it drips from there as well. It
would seem to be coming from right under Sharon's &
Steven's bathroom area. Property # 4 Turnpike Link.

The
staining and the leaching is heavy. It is difficult to move
around in the garage and the dripping is falling on other
items making them soggy and damp. Mould is beginning to
catch on and might make it a health issue with spores they
give out.

The
current situation must be more than a year old. And, we have
to drain all the pots and pans every time we visit the
garage.

I
approached the other neighbour's at the behest of Sharon
and Steve since they claimed that they dont think that this
time it has anything to do with their property since there
is no sign of dampness etc. within their property - though
in the past there was one such leak which they said was
ongoing work in their bathroom which subsequently their
decorator "tiled" over and it seemed to have
disappeared.

The
symptoms of this leak is the same. We have done tests like
turning the taps on etc. to see whether there could be a
direct link to this leak. But, they were inconclusive.
However, this would not disapprove a slow leak where water
is pooling between the concrete slab and the floor of the
bathroom. It could be emanating from the joint where the
waste water goes into the shared cast iron pipe that just
unfortunately happens to pass thru my garage.

None of
the other neighbours have indicated that their section of
the pipe is leaking. They have not reported any cases of
damp now or in the past either.

I
approached a builder but he would not take the job on
because the cast iron pipe is a joint fixture involving the
whole block's insurance and he warned me about seeking
to do any exploratory work to find the cause or fix the pipe
because it would be fraught with danger, if it cracks or
breaks or causes a blockage we could be held
liable.
I have
attached pictures to show you how it is affecting the use of
our garage.
If it is
matter of being part of the insurance, like I have said
before, we do not mind joining your group and then availing
of the said insurance.
Which is
the purpose of that insurance. The pictures I have attached
could be used as a reason to make the claim. This could be
made even now because the joint building insurance covers
our garage as well.

Kindly
acknowledge receipt of this email.

Mrs Pereira
